## Acknowledgments

This package wouldn't have existed without the invaluable feedback and contributions of Paulo Guimar√£es
 and Amine Quazad. I am also indebted to the guidance of Kit Baum and Mark Schaffer, and to the great bug-spotting abilities of many users.

In addition, `reghdfe` uses several important contributions from the Stata community:

- [reg2hdfe](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457101.html), from Paulo Guimaraes, and [a2reg](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s456942.html) from Amine Quazad,
 were the inspiration and building blocks on which reghdfe was built.
- [ivreg2](http://www.repec.org/bocode/i/ivreg2.html), by Christopher F Baum, Mark E Schaffer and Steven Stillman, is the package used by default for instrumental-variable regression.
- [avar](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457689.html) by Christopher F Baum and Mark E Schaffer, is the package used for estimating the HAC-robust standard errors of ols regressions.
- [tuples](http://econpapers.repec.org/software/bocbocode/s456797.htm) by Joseph Lunchman and Nicholas Cox, is used when computing standard errors with multi-way clustering (two or more clustering variables).
- [parallel](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457527.html) by George Vega Yon is used when running reghdfe with multiple processors.
