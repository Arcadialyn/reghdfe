Several possibilities:
1) Rewrite in threaded C and use as a plugin
2) Change the acceleration method (e.g. use some new type of Kaczmarz)
3) Instead of iterating in cycles (i.e. update one FE after another and so on), notice that
- Picking random FEs to iterate/accelerate may be more efficient
- Focusing on the GROUPS/INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE KEY NODES IN THE UNDERLYING NETWORK. AND ACCELERATING THEM MORE,
will be very efficient b/c most of the speed problems with the iteration occur with networks that are not very dense
(This problem was also mentioned by S. Gaure, P. Guimaraes, etc.)
